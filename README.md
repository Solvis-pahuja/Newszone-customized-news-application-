### Running the App

### Configuration

- **News API Setup**: This app uses a news API to fetch articles. You need an API key from a news provider (e.g., [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)). Follow these steps:
  - Sign up and get an API key from your chosen news provider.
  - Create a file named `config.dart` in the `lib/` directory with the following content:

    ```dart
    const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
    ```

- **Firebase Setup (Optional)**: If you plan to use Firebase for features like user authentication or notifications:
  - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
  - Add your Android/iOS app to the Firebase project.
  - Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) and place it in the appropriate directory:
    - Android: `android/app/`
    - iOS: `ios/Runner/`
  - Add Firebase dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file as specified in the [Firebase Flutter documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview).
